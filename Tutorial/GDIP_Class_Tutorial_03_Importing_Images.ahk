    ; Tutorial to take make a gui from an existing image on disk
    ; For the example we will use png as it can handle transparencies. The image will also be halved in size

    ; Create a layered window (+E0x80000 : must be used for UpdateLayeredWindow to work!) that is always on top (+AlwaysOnTop), has no taskbar entry or caption
    Gui, 1: -Caption +E0x80000 +LastFound +AlwaysOnTop +ToolWindow +OwnDialogs +HWNDguiHwnd

    ; Show the window
    Gui, 1: Show, NA

        MsgBox, 48, File loading error!, Could not load 'background.png'

    ; This will be the dimensions that the file is

    ; Create a gdi bitmap with width and height of what we are going to draw into it. This is the entire drawing area for everything

    ; DrawImage will draw the bitmap we took from the file into the graphics of the bitmap we created
    ; We are wanting to draw the entire image, but at half its size

    ; The source height and width are specified, and also the destination width and height (half the original)
    ; Gdip_DrawImage(pGraphics, pBitmap, dx, dy, dw, dh, sx, sy, sw, sh, Matrix)
    ; d is for destination and s is for source. We will not talk about the matrix yet (this is for changing colours when drawing)
    gdip.Gdip_DrawImage(G, pBitmap, 0, 0, Width//2, Height//2, 0, 0, Width, Height)

    ; Update the specified window we have created (guiHwnd) with a handle to our bitmap (hdc), specifying the x,y,w,h we want it positioned on our screen
    ; So this will position our gui at (0,0) with the Width and Height specified earlier (half of the original image)

    ; Select the object back into the hdc
    gdip.SelectObject(hdc, obm)

    ; Now the bitmap may be deleted
    gdip.DeleteObject(hbm)

    ; Also the device context related to the bitmap may be deleted
    gdip.DeleteDC(hdc)

    ; The graphics may now be deleted
